This project is a simple yet robust command-line calculator built using Python. It allows users to perform the four fundamental arithmetic operations—Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division—with real-time user interaction and input validation. The goal is to help beginners understand core programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, error handling, and user input.
